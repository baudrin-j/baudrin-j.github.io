I will be defending my thesis on Friday December, 6th at 2pm.
It will take place at Inria Paris research center (see below).
If you want to attend or to have access to the online broadcast, please contact me :)

## Research
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
I work on symmetric cryptography and discrete mathematics.

Since September 2021, I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Anne Canteaut](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Anne.Canteaut/) & [Léo Perrin](https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/), whithin the [COSMIQ](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/) team, at Inria.

During my first years of PhD, I mainly cryptanalyzed **symmetric** primitives, especially **lightweight** ones, such as *Ascon* (winner of the NIST lightweight competition) or *Midori*.

More recently, I started studying **Boolean functions**, and more specifically their cryptographic properties such as **APN**-ness (Almost Perfect Non-linear functions).

I am also part of some workgroups whose purposes are to **design** new primitives either for new use cases or focused on extreme performances.
